    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p> Mount Timpanogos is the second tallest mountain peak in the state of 
        Utah, named after the Timpanogos tribe native to the area. It is a 
        popular summer hike with a beautiful view and 2 different trails leading
        up to the top. The image above is a view of Mount Timpanogos from near 
        the Timpanooke Trailhead. Between the two trails, the Timpanooke Trail 
        is the most popular. Although the Aspen Grove Trail is shorter, it is
        steeper and more difficult. The Timpanooke Trail is longer but has a 
        more gradual incline. The best time to hike Mount Timpanogos is in the 
        summer between July and September after the snow has melted. A 
        popular time of day to hike is early in the morning to avoid the heat of
        the day and often people will hike to the top to watch the sunrise. To 
        do this, you will need to start hiking around 2:00 am and sleep is 
        recommended before the hike.

    <h2>Unique Crash Site</h2>
    <p>
        One incredible site that can be visited on Mount Timpanogos is the B-25
        Bomber crash site. On March 9, 1955, a B-25 Bomber crashed into the
        mountain. The plane was heading from Hill Air Force Base to Califorinia.
        The crash was caused by a combination of bad weather and pilot error 
        and killed all 5 crew members on board. The crash is located 
        about 2 miles from the summit of Mount Timpanogos. The site is a
        popular destination on the Timpanooke Trail and a historicaly remarkable
        place to visit. It is marked by a plaque and several pieces of the plane
        scattered along the mountain.
